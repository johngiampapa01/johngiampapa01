## About Me

I am a recent graduate from Adelphi University with a bachelor's degree in computer science with a cybersecurity track. I am particularly interested in information technology and cybersecurity and enjoy learning new skills and applying them to real-world problems. I am motivated to continue learning and applying what I learned personally and professionally.

## Current Objectives

My current objective is seeking an entry-level position in either information technology or cybersecurity, in which I can apply the skills I gained in and out of college through hands-on professional experience while also continuing to grow and expand my knowledge and skills.

## Projects
The first major project I worked on was Tech Talk Hub with contributions from Joseph Kiesche and Devin Szpilka. This project was a forum website for users to connect and talk about all things tech. The features included Create Account, Login, Forum Posts, Comments, Filters, User Profiles, and an admin account that could delete forums and user accounts.

The second major project I worked on was PartyPal, with contributions from Joseph Kiesche and Devin Szpilka. This project was a "looking for a group" website that allowed gamers from supported games to find groups to play with. The features included Create Account, Login, Forum Posts, Group Messaging, Friends List, Profile, Admin Privileges, and an About Us and FAQ section.
