## About Me

I am a recent graduate from Adelphi University with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science with a Cybersecurity Track. I am always thrilled to learn new skills and apply them to real world applications that can further my experience and understanding.

## Current Objectives

Troughtout my journey learning about Computer Science in college I am particularly interested in Cybersecurity and Data Analytics. I am eager to start my career in either of those fields and show what I learned throughout college and expand my skillset through in-job experience.

## Projects
The first major project I worked on was Tech Talk Hub with contributions from Joseph Kiesche and Devin Szpilka. This project was a forum website for users to connect and talk about all things tech. The features included Create account, Login, Forum posts, comments, filters, User profiles and an admin account that could delete forums and user accounts.
